## Feature requests

For feature requests, please raise them in issues and describe it at a feature to help prioritization.

## Pull-Requests

If you want to raise a pull-request with a new feature, or a refactoring
of existing code, it may well get rejected if you haven't discussed it on
the GitHub issues first.


## Coding standards

Please ensure you follow the coding standards used through-out the existing
code base. Some basic rules include:

 - indent with 4-spaces, no tabs. No arguments.
 - opening brace on same line as `if`/`for`/`function` and so on, closing brace
 on its own line.
